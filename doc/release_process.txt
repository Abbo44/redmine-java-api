Release process for Redmine Java API.
-------------------------------------

Change version number in  /pom.xml (make sure it does not have "-SNAPSHOT" at the end).
Commit and push to GIT.
Either run "mvn deploy -P sign" or run this Jenkins job: https://ta-dev.dyndns.biz:8093/job/redmine-java-api-publish
This will build, test and upload the library to OSS Sonatype Staging repository.
Go to https://oss.sonatype.org/index.html#stagingRepositories and "close" the
Redmine Staging repository, then click "Release" to finalize.
The library will be synced from that repo to Maven Central in a few hours.

Hint: deployment password, GPG key and passphrase are stored on the build server and our dev machines in .m2/settings.xml file.
